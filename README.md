# AI App Basics
Ravin Kumar, Hugo Bowne Anderson

In this tutorial we are going to go through the absolute basics of building applications using AI systems.

# American or Australian Football Detector
We'll be designing an application that can identify if a piece of text talking about an American Football team or an Australian one.

* Resistant to typos
* Multi Team classification
* If unsure indicate so


## Evaluation
* Define eval metrics for quality
* Build a basic eval loop

## Optimization
* Expose lower level inference details 
* Try different settings measure
  * Quality Changes
  * Speedup

## Iteration
* Pick another model and rerun evals
* Make decision if cost/compute expense tradeoff is worth it

## Bonus
* Con

# Coding environment
We'll be using Gemma with Ollama locally and a python environment.
If you are unable to run things locally, parts of this tutorial can be performed with Gemini API and AIStudio.

Note the principles here will extend to any AI application.
