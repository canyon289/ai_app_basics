    "Now that we have a working MVP, it’s time to test it—but before diving into structured evaluation, we’ll rely on **intuition and experimentation**.  \n",

    "- **Try different prompts** to explore how the model responds.  \n",
    "- **Observe and analyze** the model’s behavior across examples.  \n",
    "- **Identify weak spots** where results seem inconsistent or unreliable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This phase mirrors how many LLM practitioners start—tweaking and iterating based on \"vibes\" before committing to structured testing. Treat this as an **exploratory phase**: experiment, adjust, and get a feel for what works before formalizing evaluation criteria.  \n"
